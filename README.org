Hi. This is a fork of [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]] that I sometimes use to test unmerged PRs but
currently I am not testing any.

These are just PRs that I am very excited to have in Doom Emacs and am currently
testing so consider this an unstable branch of Doom Emacs. This list will be
updated as I add or remove PRs from this config.

Also, I use Emacs30 and have all my packages unpinned so if your PR is solely
bumping a package or adding compatibility with an earlier version of Emacs, I
will not merge it here.

In this fork, I have also disabled ~doom upgrade~'s ability to upgrade Doom Emacs.
To upgrade this Doom fork, you need to manually run ~git pull~.
